(Update: 09-10-2016) -> Fixed Respawn Times

(Update: 11-05-2017) -> This game is no longer in development (was my second attempt to make a game ever), so feel free to grab the code and experiment whatever you want.
If you have [LÃ–VE][2] installed in your computer you can clone this repo and play 15 levels. 

Also, if you want to add more levels there's a tool (level-maker) to create them easily.
