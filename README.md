(Update: 09-10-2016) -> Fixed Respawn Times

This game is no longer in development (was my second attempt to make a game ever), so feel free to grab the code and experiment whatever you want.
If you have [LÃ–VE][2] installed in your computer you can clone this repo and play 15 levels. 

Also, if you want to add more levels there's a tool (level-maker) to create them easily.

### SCREENSHOTS:

### TODO:

* Add support to automatically adding levels in the game from the level editor.
* Fix jump physics and collisions.
* Add more levels.
* Add menus and labels with some game information (time and score).
* Add Game+ after finish all the levels.
* Add high scores section.
* Add rules section.
* Optimize and refactor, a big part of the code is very ugly.
